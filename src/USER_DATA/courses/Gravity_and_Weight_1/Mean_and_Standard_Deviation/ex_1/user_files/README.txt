You have been hired as a medical physicist, and your first task is to report
on the level of radiation in the room where the containers of some radioactive
sources, used for radiotherapy research, are stored.

You measure the data stored in measurements.txt. The level of radiation is
measured in mSv/h, milliSievert per hour. The Sievert is the unit of ionizing
radiation dose in the International System of Units, and it represents the
effects of radiation on the human body. You need to report the average
radiation level, in mSv per year (!!), and the associated uncertainty.

Based on your result, say if the level of radiation in that room is compatible
with the natural background radiation. The latter was measured to be 2.4 mSv/y.
Assume this value has no uncertainty.
