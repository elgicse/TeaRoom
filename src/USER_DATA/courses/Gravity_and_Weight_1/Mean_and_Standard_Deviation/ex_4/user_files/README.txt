The production of neutrinos in the Sun is modeled by the so-called Solar 
Standard Model (SSM), the theory that identifies the source of energy of
stars with thermal nuclear reaction taking place inside the stars themselves.

Since the sixties, several experiments have been trying to comfirm this theory
or prove it wrong. The dominant nuclear reaction in stars, according
to the SSM, is:
  4 protons -> He + 2 electrons + 2 neutrinos + Energy
but neutrinos are produced in the Sun also by the beta decay of the A=8 isotope
of Boron, and via electron capture of the A=7 isotope of Beryllium.

In measurements.txt you will find the flux of electron neutrinos measured
since 1998 by the HOMESTAKE, GALLEX, SAGE, and SuperKamiokande experiments,
rescaled to the total neutrino flux predicted by the SSM.

Review these results, and compute their average and standard deviation.
Is the average flux compatible with the SSM prediction?
If it is not, how many standard deviations away is it from the expectation?

If you find this result interesting, think about its implications. What do
we know about neutrinos?
