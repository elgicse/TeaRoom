You are in an apprenticeship at the Astronomical Observatory of your
University. The Observatory's main targets are extrasolar planets and 
variable stars, and it contributes its data to the AAVSO and ETD catalogues.

The current campaign consists in determining the characteristics of a star
classified as type II Cepheid. The work flow involves recording images of the
stellar field containing this star with a CCD, taking images every 10 minutes.
You then analyse the amount of light recorded by the CCD and plot it against
time in order to spot variations. With these "light curves" you are then
able to derive the period and luminosity variation of a star, and even to
discover extrasolar planets transiting in front of stars known to be stable.

You observe the type II Cepheid for one month and come up with several light
curves. At the end of each observation of a full cycle,you are able to provide
an estimate of the period of the light variation.

Your period estimates are stored in measurements.txt and are expressed
in minutes.

You have devoted attention to this star because a group of amateur astrophiles
claims that the actual classification as type II Cepheid is incorrect, and
proposes a reclassification as RR Lyrae with a period of 0.7 days. RR Lyrae
are similar to Cepheids, but pulsate faster: Cepheids normally have periods
greater than 24 hours.

Extract the average period from your observations and the associated
uncertainty. Would you agree with the astrophiles and confirm their claims?
