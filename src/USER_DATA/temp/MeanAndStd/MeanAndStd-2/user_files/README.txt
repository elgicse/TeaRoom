Your institute needs to buy a Nitrogen laser to perform measurements
of air pollution. It is an expensive instrument, and you need to verify its
quality before purchasing it. In particular, you want to verify that its
wavelength is compatible with the design wavelenght of 337.1 nanometers.

You set up a diffraction grid experiment, with a wire density of 3 microns,
and have your 30 students perform measurements of the distance of the first
maximum from the center. The diffraction grid is located 1 m from the screen.
In order for the laster wavelength to be compatible with the design, this
distance needs to be 11.24 cm.

The measurements of the students are stored in measurements.txt and are
expressed in millimeters. You need to report to your students on the average
of their measurements, and on the associated uncertainty. You then need to
make a decision whether to buy this laser for your institute: are your results
compatible with the expectations? Assume no error on the design value of
11.24 cm for the position of the first maximum (i.e. this position is computed
with infinite precision) and compare it with your findings.
